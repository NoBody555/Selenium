Looking for a career job in the reputed firm, where i can learn and grow in knowledge and experience. A place where i can apply and improve my Skills. 

I truly believe Endeavor never goes in vain, it pays out in one way or the other. A Loser is the one who gives up without trying. Never lose hope, never stop trying, that\'s what i call living. Having said that, there are somethings which are insignificant and futile, wasting time on such things would do you no good, you are much better off literally doing nothing than getting involved in such things.
